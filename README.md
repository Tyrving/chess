chess
This is chess. 
I am writing this for skilled coder in the MR discord, to show I am not a pleb.

Usage:
install the processing IDE or CLI tool at 
https://processing.org. Open any of the .pde files, and press the run button. 

This does not include a computer to play chess against, this is just a game.

Steal my code please, then I won't be the only one bullied for this garbage
